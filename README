thoroData is the base module of the thorobase API.

The single global namespace 'thorobase' is defined here, as well as the 'thorobase.thorodata' namespace that incorporates all of the Model objects for encapsulating horse racing data. A helper Object.create function is also defined for older browser that do not support the Object.create prototypal inheritance design.

thorobase.thorodata.Provider acts as an interface to data supplier-specific parsing implementations of their respective file formats.
